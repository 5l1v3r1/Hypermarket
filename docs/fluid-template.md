# Fluid post and page template

Hypermarket theme requires a containing element to wrap site contents and house the entire grid system. You may choose one of two containers to use in your website pages.

?> Fluid template spans from right to left. The content of the page should take 100% of the screen's width.

The page attributes meta box allows you to select a parent page for the page and assign its order in the page hierarchy. The middle option allows you to change the template. All you have to do is select the template you want your page to use and then update the page.
