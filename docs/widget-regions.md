# Widget Regions

Hypermarket theme includes five widget regions.

## Shop Sidebar

Widgets placed to this region will appear to the right of the shop archive page content.

## Footer x 3

The three footer widget regions are arranged into equal width columns dependent on how many regions are active.
As an example if you have widgets in the **Footer 1** region and widgets in the **Footer 2** region, they are organized in **two equal-width columns** while Footer 3 wonâ€™t display.
