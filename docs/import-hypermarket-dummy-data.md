# Importing Dummy Data

Right after installing a fresh copy of [Hypermarket](https://wordpress.org/themes/hypermarket/) theme and [WooCommerce plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) you may find you have an empty store. There are no products, orders, reviews, and more by default. We’ve done that so you can get started right away creating your own products and setting up WooCommerce exactly for the needs of your store.

?> We’ve got some sample data just for you! :)

This sample data for WooCommerce is located in a file called dummy-data.xml, which is located in the WooCommerce plugin folder under ```woocommerce/dummy-data/```. You can certainly re-download WooCommerce to your computer, or get the file from your server via SFTP, etc…, but the easiest might be to just right click and [download it from here](https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/woocommerce/tags/3.0.0/dummy-data/dummy-data.xml?dl=1).
