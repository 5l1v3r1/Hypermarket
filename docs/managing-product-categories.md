# Managing Product Categories

Product categories are the main way to group products with similar features. You can also add sub categories if needed.

## Add or edit product categories

Similar to **categories** on your posts in WordPress, you can **add, delete, and edit** your product categories here.

* Add a **Name**.
* Optionally, add a **Slug**; this is the URL-friendly version of the name.<br/>
*You can leave slug name field **empty**, and it will be generated automatically from the color name.*
* Choose a **Parent** if this is a subcategory.
* Optionally, give a Description.<br/>
*Hypermarket theme will display this below the category title.*
* Choose the **Display type**. Here, you decide what is shown on the category’s landing page. <br/>
***Standard** will take your theme’s default. **Subcategories** will display only the subcategories. <br/>
**Products** will only display products. <br/>
**Both** will display subcategories and products below that.*
* Optionally, Upload/Add Image.<br/>
*Hypermarket theme by default shows product category images on the homepage template.*
