# Install and activate Hypermarket child theme

Before making changes to the theme code, we recommend that you install a [child theme](https://github.com/mahdiyazdani/Hypermarket-Child/releases). This ensures that your changes won’t be lost when updating to a new version of Hypermarket.

* Start by [downloading the Hypermarket child theme](https://github.com/mahdiyazdani/Hypermarket-Child/releases).
* Go to **Appearance** » **Themes** and Click on the **Add New** button at the top.
* Click **Upload Theme** button.
* Click **Browse** and choose the file you just downloaded, then click **Install Now**.
* Once it is installed, click on the **activate** button, and you’ve successfully installed and activated the Hypermarket child theme.
