# Create and setup a homepage template

The **Homepage template** is perfect for store owners, as it displays a lot of products and product categories to visitors as soon as they land on your website. This is the page template used on the [Hypermarket Demo](https://demo.mypreview.one/hypermarket/) and is used by default on a fresh install for brand new shops.

* Create a new page, by visiting **Pages** » **Add New**.
* Set the **page title** and then from the Template drop-down in the **Page Attributes** meta box select **Homepage template**.
* **Publish** the page.
* Navigate to **Settings** » **Reading** and set the newly created page as a **front page**.

?> Assuming you added some products to your shop, you should see links to them and links to the top level product categories when visiting the **front page**. Rearrange or hide sections using the [Hypermarket Plus](https://www.mypreview.one) plugin.
