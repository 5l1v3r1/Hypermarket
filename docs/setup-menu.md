# Creating your menu

Hypermarket theme has only one menu location. The **primary navigation** appears to the right of the site logo adjacent to the user login and WooCommerce mini cart icon *(assuming WooCommerce is active)*.

## Defining a menu

* Start by visiting **Appearance** Â» **Menus**.
* Select **Create a new menu** at the top of the page.
* Enter a name for your new menu in the **Menu Name** box.
* Click the **Create Menu** button and your new custom menu has now been defined.
